          <p class="govuk-body">Solid walls may be made from brick or stone. If your home was built before 1930, itâ€™s
            likely to have solid walls.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">You may have both types. For example, you have a pre-1930 home with an extension built
            later than 1930.
          </p>

            <div class="govuk-details__text">

              <p class="govuk-body">Solid brick walls will have an alternating pattern, with some bricks laid across the
                wall so you can see the smaller ends from the outside.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body">If your home has cavity walls, the bricks typically have an even pattern with all
                bricks laid lengthways.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body"> If the brickwork has been covered, you may be able to tell by measuring the width
                of the wall. Measure the depth of the
                wall by a window or door on one of your external walls.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body">If a brick wall is more than 260mm thick, then it is probably a cavity wall.</p>

              <p class="govuk-body">A narrower wall is probably a solid wall. Stone walls may be thicker still but are
                usually solid.</p>
